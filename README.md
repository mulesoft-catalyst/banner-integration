# slate2-banner-integration



Slate provides an Application Portal for students to apply for admissions, visits and gathering information for graduate, undergraduate, transfer and international students. 
Banner is a comprehensive ERP that contains information on courses, students, finance, faculty, staff, and alumni. Banner provides information to users through either internet-based forms or through web access using Luminis Portal Product. Banner uses Oracle DB as the backend system to store all transactions.  
Banner is designed for Higher Education.

This accelerator is going to explain how studentsâ€™ admissions data is replicated from slate to banner system.
